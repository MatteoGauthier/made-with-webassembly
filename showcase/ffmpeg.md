ffmpeg.wasm is a pure WebAssembly / JavaScript port of FFmpeg. It enables video & audio record, convert and stream right inside browsers.

FFmpeg is a famous framework/tool when it comes to video/audio processing, now with ffmpeg.wasm you can use FFmpeg right inside your browser without installation or upload your file to the server. Although ffmpeg.wasm is not as fast as FFmpeg, but it might come in handy for certain use cases.
